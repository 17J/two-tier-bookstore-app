Production Phase Enhancements for GitLab CI/CD Pipeline
This document outlines the key enhancements required to adapt the GitLab CI/CD pipeline for a production environment, ensuring reliability, security, and scalability for a three-tier application deployed via GitOps with ArgoCD on an AKS cluster.
Branch Strategy

Trigger CI/CD pipelines only on release/* branches instead of main for controlled production deployments.
Implement branch protection rules for release/* to require approvals before merging.

Environment Separation

Define a production environment in GitLab with protected variables and approval gates.
Use a dedicated AKS cluster for production (e.g., prodbook instead of devbook).

Image Versioning

Use semantic versioning (e.g., v1.0.0) alongside commit SHA for Docker images to ensure clarity.
Avoid using the :latest tag in production manifests to guarantee traceability.

Security Enhancements

Enforce stricter Trivy scans, failing the pipeline on MEDIUM severity vulnerabilities or higher.
Configure SonarQube quality gates to block pipelines if code quality thresholds are not met.
Use Snyk for continuous dependency monitoring, beyond CI scans.
Run Gitleaks on every commit and fail the pipeline if secrets are detected.

Approval Process

Require manual approval in GitLab Environments before executing the CD pipeline.
Add multiple approvers for production deployments to ensure oversight.

Rollback Mechanism

Store previous image versions in manifests to enable quick rollback.
Configure ArgoCD rollback using argocd app rollback for sync failure recovery.

Monitoring and Alerts

Integrate Prometheus/Grafana for real-time monitoring of AKS deployments.
Add Slack/Email notifications for pipeline success or failure using GitLab webhooks.
Configure ArgoCD notifications to alert on application sync status.

Infrastructure as Code

Use Terraform to provision AKS and ArgoCD resources, stored in a separate repository.
Version control k8s-manifests/ in a dedicated repository for better governance.

Secrets Management

Store sensitive variables (e.g., AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET, ARGOCD_AUTH_TOKEN) in HashiCorp Vault or Azure Key Vault.
Use GitLabâ€™s protected variables for production-specific secrets.

High Availability

Configure AKS with multiple nodes and availability zones for redundancy.
Set up ArgoCD with high availability by running multiple replicas.

Testing

Add end-to-end (E2E) tests in the CI pipeline before Docker image builds.
Implement canary deployments with ArgoCD for gradual production rollouts.

Logging

Integrate ELK Stack or Loki for centralized logging of application and pipeline events.
Enable audit logs for ArgoCD and AKS to track changes.

Resource Limits

Define CPU and memory limits/requests in Kubernetes manifests to prevent resource exhaustion.
Use Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) for frontend and backend deployments.

Backup and Recovery

Schedule regular backups of AKS persistent volumes and manifests.
Test disaster recovery procedures for AKS and ArgoCD to ensure resilience.

Documentation

Maintain a production runbook for pipeline operations and troubleshooting.
Document rollback and recovery steps in the repository for quick reference.
